				<h1>Kim Dokja</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Kim Dokja was a tremendously well-written and relatable character since he is, at his core, a lonely but devoted and compassionate man. He is deeply committed to the people he cares about, even willing to give his life in their defense; as a result of this commitment, he is cautious about who he confides in.</li> 
						<li> He frequently strives to protect his loved ones from harm by taking on their challenges, and he frequently exhibits tremendous self-deprecation when he is unable to overcome those challenges alone. This pattern of conduct of self-criticism is persistent.</li>  
						<li> In contrast to how he treats his loved ones, he is extremely harsh, insecure, and has very low self-esteem and self-worth toward himself.</li> 
						<li> However, he is incredibly committed to his objectives as seen by the fact that he overcomes even death to get to the conclusion of the scenarios.</li> 
						<li> I really adore this character because he is willing to sacrifice his life and goes above and beyond by making an alter ego of himself so that his companions won't think he's passed away.</li> 
						<li> He also attempts to plan a happy ending where his companions survive even without him.</li> 
						<li> In conclusion, Kim Dokja is a character who imagined himself to be a spectator or bystander in the stories of his comrades, but in truth, he doesn't understand how they perceive him as an essential component in their narrative, one in which he constantly makes sacrifices and protects them.</li> 
						<li> He never understood how much his friends valued and cherished him as a member of their family, which serves as a lesson in how, even if we are unable to see or feel their actions, they still care about us deeply.</li>
						<li> As a result, we should be aware of how many people care about us and treat ourselves with compassion for their sakes. </li>
