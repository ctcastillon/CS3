				<h1>Han Sooyoung</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Han Sooyoung exudes a lot of self-assurance in both her appearance and her abilities. </li>
						<li>She is a very talented writer who calls herself a genius, and she has the money to prove it: before "Ways of Survival" became a reality, she was a very well-known author who had amassed enormous wealth from her works. </li>
						<li>Her self-assurance does, however, sometimes get in the way as she exhibits stubbornness and takes a little longer to accept her mistakes.</li>
						<li>This character's portrayal of a flawed human being struck me as realistic; while she may come out as flawless, self-assured, and helpful, everyone has a secret side that they would rather keep hidden. </li>
						<li>Just remember that human beings are capable of growth and that relationships with others need time to develop.</li>
						<li>Even though she makes every effort to protect the people she cares about, she will criticize them. </li>
						<li>She regularly demonstrates her extreme independence and idealistic outlook on the future. </li>
						<li>She puts in a lot of effort to get the result she wants.</li>
					<ul>
