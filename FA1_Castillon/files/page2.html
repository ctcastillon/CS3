				<h1>Uriel</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Uriel is one of my favorite characters because he represents the reader who initially considers Kim Dokja as a character but eventually develops a romantic interest in him.</li>
						<li>She is a likeable character because I can relate with her because I read books and novels frequently, which makes me fantasize about imaginary people and cause me to experience real emotions for them.</li> 
						<li>She and I are similar in that I sometimes find fictional relationships to be enjoyable and am a huge fan of their cute interaction, which makes my heart flutter.</li>
					</ul>
