 		<h3>Jamming to "Fields of Gold" by Sting</h3>
 	<p>You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
	Upon the fields of barley<br>
 	You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
 	As we walk in fields of gold </p>
	 <p>So she took her love<br>
 	For to gaze awhile<br>
 	Upon the fields of barley<br>
 	In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
 	Among the fields of gold</p>
 	<p>Will you stay with me, will you be my love<br>
 	Among the fields of barley<br>
 	We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
 	As we lie in fields of gold</p>
