	<h1 class="m">Personality</h1>
	<p>At his core, Kim Dokja is a devoted and loving person. Due of his love to those he cares about and his willingness to offer his life in their defense, he is selective about who he confides his deepest faith.. He frequently strives to protect his loved ones from harm by taking on their challenges, and when he is unable to fight through those struggles alone, he frequently exhibits extreme self-deprecation. This pattern of behavior of self-deprecation is recurrent. Despite the fact that he loves people, he is quite harsh on himself since he is insecure and lacks confidence in himself. Overall, he is incredibly committed to his objectives but perhaps a little self-conscious about how others perceive him.</p>
