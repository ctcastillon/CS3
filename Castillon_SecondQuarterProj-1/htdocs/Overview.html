  <h1 class="m">History</h1>
	<p>Kim Dokja is the lone reader of "Ways of Survival," a webnovel. It's because the novel's characters became sources of solace for Kim Dokja as he fought through his tragic circumstances. Kim Dokja experiences a string of misfortunes, including failing his CSAT and enrolling in a third-rate university, serving on the front lines during his military service, and receiving a low-paying job at Minosoft. Throughout it all, he reads the webnovel's daily updates, commenting on each chapter and encouraging the author while making his own suggestions. With this, Kim Dokja continued his life as if the webnovel was the sole reason for him to live, but as the novel nears its conclusion, fiction collides with reality.</p>
