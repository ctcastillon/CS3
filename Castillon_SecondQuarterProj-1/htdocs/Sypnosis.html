  <h1 class="m">Sypnosis</h1>
	<p>Kim Dokja grew up with a passion for reading, which his mother supported. His father frequently mistreated both his mother and him. Kim Dokja's experience at school was not any better because he was subjected to verbal and physical harassment from his peers. Things finally came to an end when Kim Dokja retaliated by stabbing his own father to death. His mother gave Kim Dokja a false narrative right away, accusing herself of being the murderer so her son could escape. Lee Sookyung authored a best-selling book about their turbulent home life and how she killed her spouse in order to prove this to be true. The money from the book's sales was supposed to go to her kid, but it ended up in the hands of his negligent foster parents. Kim Dokja was bullied because he was called the "son of a killer" as a result, and by the time he was 15 he had had enough and jumped out of his classroom window with the intention of killing himself. Despite surviving the fall, he was hospitalized due to severe injuries. Han Sooyoung (1863rd), who visited him at this time in her younger body, was appalled.When Kim Dokja was able to move around, the dokkaebi king gently guided him to the hospital computer, where he typed the words that would lead him to the novel that would save his life. Later, Kim Dokja would go on to become the sole reader of all 3,149 chapters of the webnovel "Ways of Survival," the characters in which would become sources of comfort for him as he struggled through his unfortunate life, and he would develop a close relationship with YooÂ  Joonghyuk.</p>
